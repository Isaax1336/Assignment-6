# Assignment-6

* Examples 1, 2, & 3 are represented with the first scene, which would not build due to some unseen error.
* Example 4 shows the NavMeshLink with an enemy. The enemy follows you everywhere, though, and there is no counter.
* Example 5 shows a new skeleton model. The model only has the idle animation. 

#### Im not really sure why this assignment went the way that it did. I really tried on this, but its really frustrating and demoralizing when things dont work the way they should, even if you seemingly do everything right. Im gonna keep trying my best though.
